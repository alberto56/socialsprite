SOCIAL SPRITE
*************

CSS code and a sprite which you can add to any website, providing you with social network buttons in a variety of sizes.
Open example.html in a browser to see what this does, and examine example.html's code in a text editor.

FEATURES
********

- Five sizes: 16, 24, 32, 53, 64px squares.
- Hovers
- Uses sprite for faster loading
- Extendable (see below).
- Accessible (buttons have text).

USAGE
*****

- start by opening example.html in a browser, and examining its code, to get a feel for this project.
- add sprite.css and sprite.png in the same folder in your website.
- reference sprite.css from your html
- you must add two classes to an element which has display: block (*) for this to work: one class for the size (e.g. social-icon-32 for 32px square) and one for the type (e.g. social-icon-twitter).

(*) If you are adding these classes to an element which has display: inline (most often an "a"), you might want to give it display:block or display:inline-block.

EXTENDING
*********

If you want to add other icons, you need to have access to a web server with php, you need to be confortable adding a line to a php file, and you need to be able to edit psd (Photoshop) files. Do the following:

(1) add the icons in the psd file for all sizes, right after the last icon. (Extend the canvas to the right if necessary).
(2) Open generator.php in a text editor and near the top add your icon to the array of icons, at the end.
(3) Open generator.php in your browser, making sure you're opening it from a web server and not your local file system. It will generate an example usage.
(4) Copy the body code of the web page generated by generator.php and put it instead of example.html
(5) Copy the css code of the web page generated by generator.php and put it in sprite.css
